# Seaport-Go

## WIP - WORK IN PROGRESS.

The Goal is to replicate Seaport-js with Golang and to do that I'll have to implement the following functionality:

- createOrder
- signOrder
- cancelOrder
- bulkCancelOrders
- validate
- getOrderStatus
- getCounter
- getOrderHash
- fulfilOrder
- fulfilOders
- matchOrders
